- ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @Alejors, my name is Alejandro (easy to pronounce to anyone familiar with Lady Gaga), but my friends call me Ale or Alejo.
- ðŸŒ± I love simple life, problem-solving, learning, languages, videogames, movies and music. My goal nowadays is learning everything I need to get my programming dreamwork in which I can work remotely, since I'm moving to Ecuador on November 2022.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of programming. Some time ago began taking 2 online courses: CS50 by edX and The Odin project. At this moment I began the Full-stack Bootcamp at 4GeeksAcademy.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the learning process of anyone who I can help. Mostly spanish or english since those are the languages I speak the most, but I'm willing to try helping anyone.
- ðŸ“« If you want to reach me, my email is alejoatria@gmail.com, LinkedIn /alejandroatria or instagram @alejors.
