 - I'm a full-stack web-developer on the making. I’m currently learning the basics of programming. Some time ago began taking 2 online courses: CS50 by edX and The Odin project. I'm just finishing my Full-Stack bootcamp @ 4GeeksAcademy. <br/>
      I'm learning everything I need to get my programming dreamwork in which I can work remotely, since I'm moving to Ecuador on November 2022.<br/>
             I mostly speak spanish and english and I'm willing to help anyone who needs a different angle at their problems.<br/>
