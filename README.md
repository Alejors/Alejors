- ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @Alejors, my name is Alejandro (easy to pronounce to anyone familiar with Lady Gaga), but my friends call me Ale or Alejo.
- ðŸŒ± I love simple life, problem-solving, learning, languages, videogames, movies and some music. My goal nowadays is finding a nice spot on earth where I can enjoy sunlight, soil and fresh air on my personal time.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of programming. Actually taking 2 online courses: CS50 by edX and The Odin project. Also began learning Haitian creole and french, but left that aside while learning to code.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the learning process of anyone who I can help. Mostly spanish speaker since is my mother tongue, but I'm willing to try help anyone I can.
- ðŸ“« If you want to reach me, my email is alejoatria@gmail.com or instagram @alejors.
